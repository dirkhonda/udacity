    "## Domain Background\n",
    "For most individuals, home ownership is the largest and most important financial decision they will make. With approximately 64% of Americans owning a home [[*]](https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf) determining the fair market value of a home is critical. Historically, the value of homes has been predicated on the sale of homes in the area with similar features (e.g., beds, baths, living square footage). This approach is susceptible to outliers and variances that could skew the value of homes. The Kaggle competition, [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) provides a dataset to which feature engineering, feature selection, and machine learning techniques can be applied to gain intuition and develop a model capable of producing future fair market values with greater accuracy. With over 12 years of residential real estate software experience, most dealing with this type of data, I have always been fascinated with the pricing of real estate. It is my intention to gain more real-world experience with the analysis of datasets, specifically those in real estate, as this will be invaluable to future employers."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "As stated in the domain background, house prices are generally modeled on recently sold comparable homes (sales comps). This approach is based on the opinions and experience of brokers and realtors. As such it is susceptible to fluctuations, outliers, and human bias. By applying machine learning algorithms, a more robust and accurate regression model can be developed which can be evaluated by making sale price predictions on data prior to sale and then comparing them to their respective future purchase price."

    "## Solution Statement\n",
    "The solution will begin with data exploration to gain intuition and understanding of the attributes and features available. Next, data cleansing will be utilized to remove outliers, correct missing or null values from the training set. Additional analysis will be performed with statistical data visualizations with seaborn. These visualizations should aid in the selection of features which will be used as dimensions of the following machine learning models: linear regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. After training each model, the model will be evaluated by RMSE between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. The algorithms will then be tuned with grid search of hyperparameters. After repeating and refining the scores, a csv file will be submitted for official evaluation against an unknown dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/submit). Submissions will be evaluated by RMSE between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.\n",
